Supply Chain Optimization Using Data Analytics

Target Companies: Twiga Foods, Safaricom, Swvl etc
Project Idea:
Build a data-driven solution that analyzes and optimizes the supply chain for a company. Using open-source data that is closely related to the conditions or better to simulate the data as the objective is to be able to learn how to draw decision making insights from a given data set. 

I will Focus on:

    Identifying bottlenecks in logistics or delivery routes.
    Optimizing inventory levels based on demand patterns.
    Using predictive analytics to reduce costs and increase efficiency.
    Dashboard showcasing real-time insights on key performance indicators (KPIs) like lead time, cost per delivery, and demand forecasting.
